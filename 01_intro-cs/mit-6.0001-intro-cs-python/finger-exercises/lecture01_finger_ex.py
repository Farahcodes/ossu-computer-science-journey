# Finger Exercise Lecture 1
# Problem: Assume 3 variables a, b, and c are already defined.
# Create a variable called total that adds a and b then multiplies the result by c.
# Print the value of total.

# Assuming a, b, c are defined (for testing purposes, we can define them here)
a = 5
b = 10
c = 2

# Your code:
total = (a + b) * c

# Print the result:
print(total) # Should be 30

# You can test with other values:
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
total = (a + b) * c
print(total) # Should be 9
