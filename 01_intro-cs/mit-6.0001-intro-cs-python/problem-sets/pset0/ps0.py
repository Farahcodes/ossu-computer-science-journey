# 1. At the top of your file and type: import numpy
import numpy

# 2. Now write a line that sets a variable named x to 5.
x = 5

# 3. Now write a line that sets a variable named y to 8.
y = 8

# 4. Add variables x and y, and save the result to a variable named z.
z = x + y

# 5. Now save the result of this command: numpy.log2(z) to a variable named a.
a = numpy.log2(z)

print(f"The value of x is: {x}") # 5
print(f"The value of y is: {y}") # 8
print(f"The value of z (x + y) is: {z}") # 13
print(f"The value of a (numpy.log2(z)) is: {a}") # 3.700439718141092
