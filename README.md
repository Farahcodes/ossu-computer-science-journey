# My OSSU Computer Science Journey

This repository documents my progress through the [Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

It's designed for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, similar to an undergraduate computer science major.

## Curriculum Structure & Topics:

The curriculum is organized into main sections, each covering specific fundamental and advanced topics.

### 01_intro-cs/ (Introduction to Computer Science)

This section introduces the world of computer science and programming, giving a flavor of the material to come.

* **Topics covered:** computation, imperative programming, basic data structures and algorithms, and more.

### 02_core-cs/ (Core Computer Science)

Corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, covering classes all majors would be required to take.

#### core-programming/
* **Topics covered:** functional programming, design for testing, program requirements, common design patterns, unit testing, object-oriented design, static typing, dynamic typing, ML-family languages (via Standard ML), Lisp-family languages (via Racket), Ruby, and more.

#### core-math/
* **Topics covered:** discrete mathematics, mathematical proofs, basic statistics, O-notation, discrete probability, and more.

#### cs-tools/
* **Topics covered:** terminals and shell scripting, vim, command line environments, version control, and more.

#### core-systems/
* **Topics covered:** procedural programming, manual memory management, boolean algebra, gate logic, memory, computer architecture, assembly, machine language, virtual machines, high-level languages, compilers, operating systems, network protocols, and more.

#### core-theory/
* **Topics covered:** divide and conquer, sorting and searching, randomized algorithms, graph search, shortest paths, data structures, greedy algorithms, minimum spanning trees, dynamic programming, NP-completeness, and more.

#### core-security/
* **Topics covered:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Secure Design, Defensive Programming, Threats and Attacks, Network Security, Cryptography, and more.

#### core-applications/
* **Topics covered:** Agile methodology, REST, software specifications, refactoring, relational databases, transaction processing, data modeling, neural networks, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, OpenGL, ray tracing, and more.

#### core-ethics/
* **Topics covered:** Social Context, Analytical Tools, Professional Ethics, Intellectual Property, Privacy and Civil Liberties, and more.

### 03_advanced-cs/ (Advanced Computer Science)

Corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, focusing on electives chosen based on interest after completing Core CS.

#### advanced-programming/
* **Topics covered:** debugging theory and practice, goal-oriented programming, parallel computing, object-oriented analysis and design, UML, large-scale software architecture and design, and more.

#### advanced-systems/
* **Topics covered:** digital signaling, combinational logic, CMOS technologies, sequential logic, finite state machines, processor instruction sets, caches, pipelining, virtualization, parallel processing, virtual memory, synchronization primitives, system call interface, and more.

#### advanced-theory/
* **Topics covered:** formal languages, Turing machines, computability, event-driven concurrency, automata, distributed shared memory, consensus algorithms, state machine replication, computational geometry theory, propositional logic, relational logic, Herbrand logic, game trees, and more.

#### advanced-information-security/
* **Topics covered:** Web Security Fundamentals, Security Governance & Compliance, Digital Forensics Concepts, Secure Software Development: Requirements, Design, and Reuse, Secure Software Development: Implementation, Secure Software Development: Verification and More Specialized Topics.

#### advanced-math/
* **Topics covered:** Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Formal Logic, Probability.

### 04_final-project/ (Final Project)

A culminating project to validate, consolidate, and display acquired knowledge, solving a real-world problem or improving an existing tool.

### `extras/`
This directory will contain any high-quality courses or readings that are not part of the main OSSU curriculum but are valuable for deeper learning or personal interest.

### `personal-notes/`
A space for general reflections, learning logs, and broader insights not tied to a specific course or project.

## How to Navigate This Repository:

Each course or major problem set within this repository will have its own dedicated folder containing my code, notes, and a detailed `README.md` file explaining the content, my approach, and how to run the code (if applicable).
