# My OSSU Computer Science Journey

This repository documents my progress through the [Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

It contains my solutions to problem sets, projects, notes, and other learning artifacts as I work through the comprehensive curriculum.

## Structure:

- `core-cs/`: Core Computer Science subjects (e.g., CS50, Algorithms, Operating Systems)
- `core-math/`: Core Mathematics subjects (e.g., Discrete Math, Calculus)
- `advanced-cs/`: Advanced Computer Science electives
- `extra-projects/`: Personal projects or additional practice outside the main curriculum


## How to Navigate:

Each course/problem set will have its own dedicated folder with a `README.md` explaining the content, my approach, and how to run the code (if applicable).
